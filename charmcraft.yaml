        Each release starts the metric-server with a specific set of arguments
        as defined by the official manifests.

        By adding space separated arguments, the flags/configs will amend and overwrite
        any existing config defined by that releases' manifest.

        example)
          #--kubelet-insecure-tls - Do not verify the CA of serving certificates presented by Kubelets. For testing purposes only.
          juju config kubernetes-metrics-server extra-args='--kubelet-insecure-tls'

    image-registry:
      type: string
      description: |
        Source registry of metrics server images.

        By setting to a value, each image listed in the component.yaml
        has its image-registry replaced.

        If unset, the component.yaml will use its default image registry.

        example)
          juju config kubernetes-metrics-server image-registry='rocks.canonical.com:443/cdk'

          juju config kubernetes-metrics-server --reset image-registry
    release:
      type: string
      description: |
        Specify the version of metrics-server as defined by
        https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases

        example)
          juju config kubernetes-metrics-server release='v0.6.1'

        A list of supported versions is available through the action:
          juju run-action kubernetes-metrics-server/0 list-releases --wait

        To reset by to the latest supported by the charm use:
          juju config kubernetes-metrics-server --reset release

        The current release deployed is available by viewing
          juju status kubernetes-metrics-server
